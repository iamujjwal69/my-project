SVG FREEHAND DRAWING TOOL

1. FEATURE: Drawing Area
   Requirement: User must be able to draw freehand using mouse.
   Implementation: Implemented with an <svg> element where paths (<path>) are dynamically created.
   VALID ACTIONS:
       - Click and drag inside the drawing area to draw.
       - Multiple strokes can be drawn.
   INVALID ACTIONS:
       - Clicking outside the drawing area will not draw.
       - Drawing without mouse press will not work.

2. FEATURE: Path Creation
   Requirement: Each stroke should be represented as an SVG <path>.
   Implementation: On mousedown, a new path is created with "M x y". On mousemove, line segments ("L x y") are appended.
   VALID EXAMPLES:
       - Continuous freehand strokes.
       - Multiple distinct paths in one session.
   INVALID EXAMPLES:
       - No path is created without pressing mouse.
       - Releasing mouse stops path creation.

3. FEATURE: Event Handling
   Requirement: Mouse events should handle drawing logic.
   Implementation:
       - mousedown → Start new stroke.
       - mousemove → Extend path.
       - mouseup → End stroke.
   Expected Output: Smooth, continuous freehand drawing.
   Invalid Case: Without mouseup, stroke would continue infinitely.

CSS STYLING BREAKDOWN: A Structured Overview

1. ELEMENT: body
   Purpose: Defines overall font styling.
   Property: font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
   Effect: Sets clean, readable text style.

2. ELEMENT: .container
   Purpose: Main wrapper for the drawing area.
   Properties & Effects:
       border: 1px solid #444; → Creates border around the tool.
       width: 600px; → Sets fixed width.
       padding: 10px; → Adds spacing inside container.

3. ELEMENT: #drawingArea
   Purpose: Defines the canvas where drawing happens.
   Properties & Effects:
       border: 1px solid #444; → Creates boundary around drawing space.
       background: #f9f9f9; → Sets light gray background.
       width: 560px, height: 400px → Fixed size canvas.
       cursor: crosshair; → Gives drawing-like pointer.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
1. Learnt how to create a scalable freehand drawing tool using SVG.
2. Understood event handling with mouse events in JavaScript.
3. Practiced working with SVG path attributes (M, L).
4. Improved CSS styling skills for user interface design.
