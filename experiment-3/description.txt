# ADMIN DASHBOARD â€“ DESCRIPTION & ANALYSIS

## OBJECTIVE
To design and develop a responsive admin dashboard interface using HTML, CSS Grid layout, and JavaScript with a theme-switching feature (Light/Dark modes).

## FEATURES & VALIDATIONS

1. Theme Switching Functionality

Requirement: Users should be able to toggle between Light Mode and Dark Mode dynamically.

Implementation:

HTML checkbox input (#theme-toggle) to switch modes.

JavaScript toggles dark-mode and light-mode classes on <body> when the checkbox state changes
.

2. Layout Structure (CSS Grid)

Requirement: Create a clean and organized layout with Header, Sidebar, Content Area, and Footer.

Implementation:

Grid template areas defined for sections: "header header", "sidebar content", "footer footer".

grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr; ensures fixed sidebar width and flexible main content
.

3. Navigation Menu

Requirement: Sidebar with navigation links.

Implementation:

Unordered list (<ul>) with list items (<li>) for Home, Users, and Settings.

Links styled with purple color and hover underline effect
.

## CSS STYLING BREAKDOWN

1. Base Layout

display: grid; for the .dashboard container.

grid-template-areas for defining section positions.
