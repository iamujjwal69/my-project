The Student Registration Form created using HTML and CSS is a simple yet effective web form that collects user details such as Name, Email, and Age. The form includes HTML5 validation to ensure the correctness and completeness of user input. The **Name field** uses the `pattern="[A-Za-z\s]+"` attribute, allowing only alphabets and spaces. It is marked as `required` to prevent empty submissions. The **Email field** is of type `email`, which automatically checks for valid email formats like `example@domain.com`. The **Age field** accepts only numeric input with `type="number"` and restricts the value between 5 and 130 using `min` and `max` attributes.

The form is visually styled using CSS. The `body` is given a light purple background and flexbox layout to center the form on the screen. The `form` element has a soft cream background, rounded corners, padding, and a green ridge border, giving it an attractive and friendly appearance. Spacing and font sizes are adjusted for better readability. A submit button is included, which triggers validations upon click.

Test cases were applied to verify form behavior. Valid inputs allow successful form submission, while invalid ones such as numbers in the name, incorrect email formats, or out-of-range ages are automatically rejected with browser error messages.

Overall, this form project helped in learning key concepts such as HTML5 input validations, regex pattern use, CSS styling for layout and design, and how to test form functionality. It serves as a strong foundation for creating user-friendly and accessible web forms.
