This project is a real-time chat application built with React.js and Socket.IO. It enables multiple users to exchange messages instantly without needing to refresh the page. The frontend, developed in React, lets users enter their name and type messages. When a message is sent, itâ€™s transmitted to the server via Socket.IO, which then broadcasts it to all connected clients. These messages appear instantly in the chat window.

The app leverages React hooks like useState for managing user input and chat data, and useEffect for handling real-time message updates from the server. The socket listens for "receive_message" events to update the message list dynamically, and the listener is properly cleaned up when the component unmounts to avoid memory leaks. The UI is simple and intuitive, styled with basic CSS for ease of use.

In essence, this project illustrates how real-time communication is implemented in web applications using WebSockets through Socket.IO, combined with React for a responsive and interactive interface.
