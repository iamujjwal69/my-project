## DYNAMIC PRODUCT FILTER: FUNCTIONALITY & STYLING

### 1. FEATURE: Product Filtering
   **Requirement**: The primary feature is to filter a list of products based on a category selected from a dropdown menu. The filtering is dynamic and happens on the client-side without a page reload.

* **ACTION: Selecting a Category from the Dropdown**
    * **"All"**: When this option is selected, all product items are displayed. The `.hidden` class is removed from all `.product-item` elements.
    * **"Clothing"**: When selected, only products with the `data-category="clothing"` attribute are displayed. All other product items have the `.hidden` class added.
    * **"Electronics"**: When selected, only products with the `data-category="electronics"` attribute are displayed. All other product items have the `.hidden` class added.
    * **"Books"**: When selected, only products with the `data-category="books"` attribute are displayed. All other product items have the `.hidden` class added.

* **BEHAVIOR: How It Works**
    * An event listener on the dropdown triggers a function whenever the selection changes.
    * The function iterates through each product item.
    * It compares the item's `data-category` attribute to the selected value from the dropdown.
    * If they match (or if "All" is selected), it ensures the item is visible by removing the `.hidden` class.
    * If they do not match, it hides the item by adding the `.hidden` class, which sets its CSS `display` property to `none`.

### 2. CSS Styling Breakdown: A Structured Overview
Here's a breakdown of the CSS styles, organized by the element they target and their purpose:

* **ELEMENT: `body` (Page Layout)**
    * **Purpose**: Sets the overall background and centers the main content container.
    * **Properties & Effects**:
        * `background-color: #f4f4f4;`: Applies a light gray background color to the page.
        * `display: flex; justify-content: center;`: Uses Flexbox to horizontally center the `.container` within the viewport.

* **ELEMENT: `.container` (Main Content Wrapper)**
    * **Purpose**: Styles the main box that contains the filter and product list.
    * **Properties & Effects**:
        * `background-color: #fff;`: Makes the container a clean white box.
        * `padding: 20px 40px;`: Adds internal spacing for content readability.
        * `border-radius: 8px;`: Creates rounded corners for a modern look.
        * `box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);`: Applies a soft shadow, making the container appear slightly elevated.
        * `max-width: 600px;`: Ensures the container remains a readable width on large screens.

* **ELEMENT: `.filter-section` (Filter Container)**
    * **Purpose**: Creates visual separation for the dropdown filter area.
    * **Properties & Effects**:
        * `margin-bottom: 20px;`: Adds space below the filter, separating it from the product list.
        * `border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;`: Adds a subtle, light gray dividing line.

* **ELEMENT: `#categoryFilter` (Dropdown Select)**
    * **Purpose**: Styles the category selection dropdown menu.
    * **Properties & Effects**:
        * `padding: 8px;`: Adds internal spacing for a better look and feel.
        * `font-size: 16px;`: Sets a readable text size for the options.
        * `border-radius: 4px;`: Applies slightly rounded corners.

* **ELEMENT: `.product-list` (Products Container)**
    * **Purpose**: Manages the layout of the individual product items.
    * **Properties & Effects**:
        * `display: flex; flex-direction: column;`: Stacks the product items vertically.
        * `gap: 10px;`: Adds 10 pixels of space between each product item for clear separation.

* **ELEMENT: `.product-item` (Individual Product)**
    * **Purpose**: Styles the box for each individual product.
    * **Properties & Effects**:
        * `background-color: #f9f9f9;`: Sets a very light gray background to distinguish it from the main container.
        * `padding: 15px;`: Adds internal spacing.
        * `border-radius: 4px;`: Gives the items slightly rounded corners.

* **CLASS: `.hidden` (Visibility Class)**
    * **Purpose**: A utility class added via JavaScript to hide elements that don't match the filter.
    * **Property & Effect**:
        * `display: none;`: Removes the element from view and the document's layout.
