üè¶ Banking UI ‚Äì Project Description (Without Script)

This **Banking UI** project is a clean and structured front-end application built using **HTML** and **CSS**, designed to simulate a minimal banking interface. The layout consists of a balance display area, an amount input field, and two functional buttons labeled **Deposit** and **Withdraw**. Although this version does not include scripting for functionality, it visually represents how a real banking UI would look and feel.

The **HTML** forms the foundation of the interface, with semantic tags used for accessibility and clarity. The container holds three main components: a green-colored balance display (`#balance`), an input box (`#amount`) for entering the amount, and buttons for deposit and withdrawal actions. The structure is simple, readable, and ready for back-end or JavaScript integration in future stages.

The **CSS** adds life to the layout. The `body` uses flexbox to center the interface both vertically and horizontally. The `.banking-ui` container is styled with padding, a white background, rounded corners, and a soft box shadow for a modern card-like appearance. The input field is styled to span full width with proper padding and border radius. The **buttons** are visually distinguished using green (deposit) and red (withdraw), with hover effects that enhance user interaction.
